Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects, tools, and research I've undertaken to deepen my expertise in digital security, ethical hacking, and system defense (as well as relevant outside areas).

My name is Benjamin Taylor, and I’m a cybersecurity student at UNC Charlotte with a passion for protecting systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and building secure environments. This repo is a growing archive of what I’ve been working on, learning, and contributing to the cybersecurity community.

This repository is a collection of everything I’ve explored in cybersecurity on my own time. None of this is part of coursework - all of this work is done outside of school merely for personal passion and a drive to learn more.
